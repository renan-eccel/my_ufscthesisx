	abstract = {This paper presents an analytic model to predict average waiting and ridingtimes in urban transportation systems (such as dial-a-bus and taxicabs), which provide non-transfer door-to-door transportation with a dynamically dispatched fleet of vehicles. Three different dispatching algorithms are analyzed with a simple deterministic model, which is then generalized to capture the most relevant stochastic phenomena. The formulae obtained have been successfully compared with simulated data and are simple enough for hand calculation. They are, thus, tools which enable analysts to avoid cumbersome simulation models when contemplating implementing or modifying many-to-many demand responsive transportation systems.},

	abstract = {An investigation of the single-vehicle, many-to-many, immediate-request dial-a-ride problem is developed in two parts (I and {II}). Part I focuses on the “static” case of the problem. In this case, intermediate requests that may appear during the execution of the route are not considered. A generalized objective function is examined, the minimization of a weighted combination of the time to service all customers and of the total degree of “dissatisfaction” experienced by them while waiting for service. This dissatisfaction is assumed to be a linear function of the waiting and riding times of each customer. Vehicle capacity constraints and special priority rules are part of the problem. A Dynamic Programming approach is developed. The algorithm exhibits a computational effort which, although an exponential function of the size of the problem, is asymptotically lower than the corresponding effort of the classical Dynamic Programming algorithm applied to a Traveling Salesman Problem of the same size. Part {II} extends this approach to solving the equivalent “dynamic” case. In this case, new customer requests are automatically eligible for consideration at the time they occur. The procedure is an open-ended sequence of updates, each following every new customer request. The algorithm optimizes only over known inputs and does not anticipate future customer requests. Indefinite deferment of a customer’s request is prevented by the priority rules introduced in Part I. Examples in both “static” and “dynamic” cases are presented.},

The time constraints consist of upper bounds on: (1) the amount of time by which the pick-up or delivery of a customer can deviate from the desired pick-up or delivery time; (2) the time that a customer can spend riding in a vehicle. The algorithm uses a sequential insertion procedure to assign customers to vehicles and to determine a time schedule of pick-ups and deliveries for each vehicle. A flexible objective function balances the cost of providing service with the customers' preferences for pick-up and delivery times close to those requested, and for short ride times. Computational experience with the algorithm is described, including a run with a real database of 2600 customers and some 20 simultaneously active vehicles.

Bertsimas and G. van Ryzin introduced and analyzed a model for stochastic and dynamic vehicle routing in which a single, uncapacitated vehicle traveling at a constant velocity in a Euclidean region must service demands whose time of arrival, location and on-site service are stochastic. The objective is to find a policy to service demands over an infinite horizon that minimizes the expected system time (wait plus service) of the demands. This paper extends our analysis in several directions. First, we analyze the problem of m identical vehicles with unlimited capacity and show that in heavy traffic the system time is reduced by a factor of 1/m2 over the single-server case. One of these policies improves by a factor of two on the best known system time for the single-server case. We then consider the case in which each vehicle can serve at most q customers before returning to a depot. We show that the stability condition in this case depends strongly on the geometry of the region. Several policies that have system times within a constant factor of the optimum in heavy traffic are proposed. Finally, we discuss extensions to mixed travel cost and system time objectives.},

Here, “fully automated” means that under normal operation, the customer is the only human involved in the entire process of requesting a ride, assigning trips, scheduling arrivals and routing the vehicle. There are no telephone operators to receive calls, nor any central dispatchers to assign trips to vehicles, nor any human planning a route. The vehicles' computers assign trip demands and plan routes optimally among themselves, and the drivers' only job is to obey instructions from their vehicle's computer. Consequently, an {ADART} vehicle fleet covers a large service area without any centralized supervision. In effect, the vehicles behave like a swarm of ants accomplishing their chore without anyone in charge.},

The problem is characterized by, among other things, multiple capacities and multiple objectives. The capacities refer to the fact that a vehicle may be equipped with e.g. normal seats, children seats or wheel chair places. The objectives relate to a number of concerns such as e.g. short driving time, high vehicle utilization or low costs. A solution algorithm {REBUS} based on an insertion heuristics was developed. The algorithm permits in a flexible way weighting of the various goals such that the solution reflects the user's preferences. The algorithm is implemented in a dynamic environment intended for on-line scheduling. Thus, a new request for service is treated in less than 1 second, permitting an interactive user interface.},

In this paper, we consider a dynamic vehicle routing problem where one additional customer arrives at a beforehand unknown location when the vehicles are already under way. Our objective is to maximize the probability that the additional customer can be integrated into one of the otherwise fixed tours without violating time constraints. This is achieved by letting the vehicles wait at suitable locations during their tours, thus influencing the position of the vehicles at the time when the new customer arrives. For the cases of one and two vehicles, we derive theoretical results about the best waiting strategies. The general problem is shown to be {NP}-complete. Several deterministic waiting strategies and an evolutionary algorithm to optimize the waiting strategy are proposed and compared empirically. It is demonstrated that a proper waiting strategy can significantly increase the probability of being able to service the additional customer, at the same time reducing the average detour to serve that customer.},

This paper introduces a mixed-integer programming formulation of the problem and a branch-and-cut algorithm. The algorithm uses new valid inequalities for the dial-a-ride problem as well as known valid inequalities for the traveling salesman, the vehicle routing, and the pick-up and delivery problems. Computational experiments performed on randomly generated instances show that the proposed approach can be used to solve small to medium-size instances.},

For this problem, we have developed a two-phase insertion algorithm based on route perturbations: the first phase, which is run off-line when the vehicle moves between two successive stops, aims at creating a feasible neighborhood of the current route; while the second phase, which is run in real-time every time a new request occurs, inserts, when possible, the delivery stop of the new customer in the current route.},

Experimental results show that waiting and relocation strategies may dramatically improve customer service, especially for problems that are highly dynamic and contain many late requests. The decisions to wait and to relocate do not exploit any problem-specificfeaturesbut ratherare obtained by including choices in the online algorithm that are necessarily sub-optimal in an offline setting.},

In addition to capacity and time window constraints, vehicle routes must also satisfy pairing and precedence constraints on pickups and deliveries.

Several families of valid inequalities are introduced to strengthen these two formulations. These inequalities are used within branch‐and‐cut algorithms which have been tested on several instance sets for both the {PDPTW} and the {DARP}.

A fast heuristic is proposed to re-optimize the schedule when a new event occurs. This heuristic consists of a properly organized local search strategy and uses a secondary objective function to drive the search out of local optima. Intensive computational simulations were carried out to evaluate the performance of this scheduling scheme and the influence of different stochastic factors. The simulation results of different scenarios with different percentage of dynamic requests reveal that this scheduling scheme can generate high quality schedules and is capable of coping with various stochastic events.},

Depending on the hospital layout, transportation between nursing wards and service units is either provided by ambulances or by trained personnel who accompany patients on foot. In many large German hospitals, the patient transport service is poorly managed and lacks work-flow coordination. This contributes to higher hospital costs (e.g., because a patient is not delivered to the operating room on time) and to patient inconvenience (e.g., because of long waiting times). We designed a computer-based planning system, Opti-{TRANS}©, that supports all phases of the transportation flow, including travel booking, dispatching transport requests, and monitoring and reporting trips in real time. The methodology, which we developed to solve the underlying optimization problem—a dynamic dial-a-ride problem with hospital-specific constraints, draws on fast heuristic methods to ensure the efficient and timely provision of transports. We illustrate the strong impact of Opti-{TRANS} on the daily performance of the patient transportation service of a large German hospital. The major benefits of Opti-{TRANS} include streamlined transportation processes and work flow, significant savings, and improved patient satisfaction. Moreover, it has contributed to increased awareness among hospital staff of the importance of implementing efficient logistics practices.},

	abstract = {The problem studied in this paper stems from a real application to the transportation of patients in the Hospital Complex of Tours (France). The ambulance central station of the Hospital Complex has to plan the transportation demands between care units which require a vehicle. Some demands are known in advance and the others arise dynamically. Each demand requires a specific type of vehicle and a vehicle can transport only one person at a time. The demands can be subcontracted to a private company which implies high cost. Moreover, transportations are subject to particular constraints, among them priority of urgent demands, disinfection of a vehicle after the transportation of a patient with contagious disease and respect of the type of vehicle needed. These characteristics involve a distinction between the vehicles and the crews during the modeling phase. We propose a modeling for solving this difficult problem and a tabu search algorithm inspired by Gendreau et al. (1999). This method supports an adaptive memory and a tabu search procedure. Computational experiments on a real-life instance and on randomly generated instances show that the method can provide high-quality solutions for this dynamic problem with a short computation time.},

In this paper we analyze the corresponding problem arising in the daily operation of the Austrian Red Cross. This nongovernmental organization is the largest organization performing patient transportation in Austria. The aim is to design vehicle routes to serve partially dynamic transportation requests using a fixed vehicle fleet. Each request requires transportation from a patient's home location to a hospital (outbound request) or back home from the hospital (inbound request). Some of these requests are known in advance. Some requests are dynamic in the sense that they appear during the day without any prior information. Finally, some inbound requests are stochastic. More precisely, with a certain probability each outbound request causes a corresponding inbound request on the same day. Some stochastic information about these return transports is available from historical data. The purpose of this study is to investigate, whether using this information in designing the routes has a significant positive effect on the solution quality. The problem is modeled as a dynamic stochastic dial-a-ride problem with expected return transports. We propose four different modifications of metaheuristic solution approaches for this problem. In detail, we test dynamic versions of variable neighborhood search ({VNS}) and stochastic {VNS} (S-{VNS}) as well as modified versions of the multiple plan approach ({MPA}) and the multiple scenario approach ({MSA}). Tests are performed using 12 sets of test instances based on a real road network. Various demand scenarios are generated based on the available real data. Results show that using the stochastic information on return transports leads to average improvements of around 15\%. Moreover, improvements of up to 41\% can be achieved for some test instances.},

	abstract = {In this paper we study a realistic dial-a-ride problem which simultaneously considers multiple trips, heterogeneous vehicles, multiple request types, configurable vehicle capacity and manpower planning. All of these features originate from practical applications in recent years. To formulate the problem, we propose two mathematical models that use different methods to deal with requests associated with the depot. To further strengthen the models, we propose eight families of valid inequalities, and based on them, we propose a branch-and-cut algorithm to solve the problem. The branch-and-cut algorithm was extensively tested on a set of instances generated according to the data of a real world application. The computational results showed that seven families of inequalities can improve the lower bounds substantially and the branch-and-cut algorithm can solve instances with up to 22 requests within 4 h. Highlights • Introduced a more realistic variant of the dial-a-ride problem. • Formulated the problem into two models. • Proposed eight families of valid inequalities to strengthen the models. • Devised a branch-and-cut algorithm to solve the problem. • The branch-and-cut algorithm optimally solved instances with up to 22 requests.},

Due to technology advancement, especially the stochastic character of real world {VRP}'s obtains more emphasis within the solution finding process. Besides the multi scenario approach, simulation-based optimization addresses the randomness, and is proposed as a solving method. In this paper, we present a short review of existing open-source Rich {VRP} ({RVRP}) models. We introduce a {RVRP} Simulation Model and its corresponding Discrete Event Simulator. It is used to evaluate routing solution candidates for metaheuristic-driven optimization frameworks. Our implementation is published under an open source license in a public repository. We demonstrate the integration of our {RVRP} Simulator with the general purpose metaheuristic optimization framework {SEREIN} and show the feasibility of our approach by applying it to well-known Capacitated {VRP} instances.},

	abstract = {The rapid development of automated vehicles and the introduction of shared mobility services hold great potential for the development of automated public transport systems. However, their expected performance under alternative conditions and with alternative design factors remains unknown. In this study, the operation of a new automated mobility service was simulated and evaluated. The proposed transport system was defined as an automated demand-responsive transport system ({ADRTS}), which consisted of a demand-responsive public transportation service providing sharable rides without fixed routes or timetables in automated vehicles. Requests for the {ADRTS} were combined if they shared the same pickup and drop-off locations, subject to vehicle capacity limitations. Rides were launched within a predefined maximum vehicle dwell time, and routes were chosen without detours. The proposed system was tested in a field operation pilot project of the operation of automated vehicles in Wageningen in the Netherlands under conditions with different demand patterns, vehicle capacities, and operational factors. The simulation model determined the minimal and optimal fleet size for operation of the shuttle service when total operational and travel costs were minimized and maximum passenger waiting time requirements were satisfied. The results indicated that the most effective way to reduce the system cost per passenger of the {ADRTS} in the presented case study was to increase the demand level, increase the share of passengers who arrive independently, and use adequate vehicle sizes and short vehicle dwell times.},

	abstract = {This paper advocates a new paradigm of transportation systems for future smart cities, namely, public vehicles ({PVs}), that provides dynamic ridesharing trips at requests. Passengers will enjoy more convenient and flexible transportation services with much less expense. In the {PV} system, both the number of vehicles and required parking spaces will be significantly reduced. There will be less traffic congestion, less energy consumption, and less pollution. In this paper, the concept, method, and algorithm for the {PV} system are described. The key issue of effectively implementing the {PV} system is to design efficient planning and scheduling algorithms. The {PV}-path problem is formulated, which is {NP}-complete. Then, a practical approach is proposed, which can serve people anywhere and anytime. The simulation results show that, to achieve the same performance (e.g., total time, waiting time, and travel time), the number of vehicles in the {PV} system can be reduced by around 90\% and 57\% compared with the conventional vehicle system and Uber Pool, respectively, and the total traveling distance can be reduced by 34\% and 14\%.},

We first study algorithms for the online Traveling Repairman Problem ({TRP}), where a single server is to visit a set of locations in a network with the objective of minimizing the sum of weighted completion times. We then analyze well‐known online algorithms for a variety of machine scheduling problems, which are appropriate models for many network optimization problems; in the scheduling notation of Graham et al. 18, we consider 1{\textbar}rj,pmtn{\textbar}∑{jwjCj}, 1{\textbar}rj{\textbar}∑{jwjCj}, Q{\textbar}rj,pmtn{\textbar}∑{jCj}, P{\textbar}rj{\textbar}∑{jCj}, Q{\textbar}rj,pmtn{\textbar}∑{jwjCj} and Q{\textbar}rj{\textbar}∑{jwjCj}.

Our three-dimensional state–space–time network construct is able to comprehensively enumerate possible transportation states at any given time along vehicle space–time paths, and further allows a forward dynamic programming solution algorithm to solve the single vehicle {VRPPDTW} problem. By utilizing a Lagrangian relaxation approach, the primal multi-vehicle routing problem is decomposed to a sequence of single vehicle routing sub-problems, with Lagrangian multipliers for individual passengers’ requests being updated by sub-gradient-based algorithms.

	abstract = {This paper is the first part of a comprehensive survey on pickup and delivery problems. Basically, two problem classes can be distinguished. The first class, discussed in this paper, deals with the transportation of goods from the depot to linehaul customers and from backhaul customers to the depot. This class is denoted as Vehicle Routing Problems with Backhauls ({VRPB}). Four subtypes can be considered, namely the Vehicle Routing Problem with Clustered Backhauls ({VRPCB} – all linehauls before backhauls), the Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed linehauls and Backhauls ({VRPMB} – any sequence of linehauls and backhauls permitted), the Vehicle Routing Problem with Divisible Delivery and Pickup ({VRPDDP} – customers demanding delivery and pickup service can be visited twice), and the Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Delivery and Pickup ({VRPSDP} – customers demanding both services have to be visited exactly once). The second class, dealt with in the second part of this survey, refers to all those problems where goods are transported between pickup and delivery locations. These are the Pickup and Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem ({PDVRP} – unpaired pickup and delivery points), the classical Pickup and Delivery Problem ({PDP} – paired pickup and delivery points), and the Dial-A-Ride Problem ({DARP} – passenger transportation between paired pickup and delivery points and user inconvenience taken into consideration). Single as well as multi vehicle versions of the mathematical problem formulations are given for all four {VRPB} types, the corresponding exact, heuristic, and metaheuristic solution methods are discussed.},

Dial-a-ride problems differ from other routing and scheduling problems, in that they typically involve service-related constraints. It is common to have maximum wait time constraints and maximum ride time constraints. In the presence of maximum wait time and maximum ride time restrictions, it is not clear how to efficiently determine, given a sequence of pickups and deliveries, whether a feasible schedule exists. We demonstrate that this, in fact, can be done in linear time.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a preliminary study of the feasibility of checkpoint dial-a-ride systems. Their cost-effectiveness is compared to that of fixed route systems with no transfers and door-to-door dial-a-ride systems. The results are derived for a simple routing strategy, and involve some simplifications which facilitate the comparisons. For high demand levels, the total cost per passenger for fixed route and checkpoint systems is very close. In fact, their optimal configurations are so alike, and the occurrence of route deviations is so rare, that fixed route systems should be preferred, as they can be operated on a schedule and require less dispatching effort. As the demand level decreases, demand responsive systems become relatively more attractive than fixed route systems, and checkpoint systems might possibly become cost-effective. However, by the time demand responsive systems are significantly better than fixed route systems, door-to-door service can be provided at an even lower cost. This appears to limit the situations where checkpoint dial-a-ride systems can be applied efficiently to a small window of demand levels (and special situations) where they only narrowly outperform other systems.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with a combinatorial optimization problem that models situations of both dynamic ride-sharing and taxi-sharing. Passengers who want to share a taxi or a ride, use an app to specify their current location, destination and further information such as the earliest departure time, the latest arrival time and the maximum cost they are willing to pay for the ride. Car owners also specify their origin, destination, the leaving time and the maximum accepted delay. Taxi drivers report their location and the time they will start and end the service. All drivers need to define a price per kilometer. The problem is to compute routes, matching requests to vehicles in such a way that ride-sharing is allowed as long as some restrictions are satisfied, such as: the capacity of the vehicle, maximum trip cost of each passenger and maximum delay. The problem is dynamic since new requests arrive on-line and routes can be modified in order to attend them. To solve this dynamic problem, the day is divided in time periods. For each period, an instance of a static problem is created and solved by a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure ({GRASP}). Experiments with instances based on real data were made to evaluate the heuristics and the proposed method. In our simulations with taxis, passengers paid, on average, almost 30\% less than they would pay on private rides.},

This article focuses on the dynamic {PDPTW} for which future requests are not stochastically modelled or predicted. The standard solution methodology for the dynamic {PDPTW} is the use of a rolling time horizon as proposed by Psaraftis. When assigning a new request to a vehicle it may be preferable to consider the impact of a decision both on a short-term and on a long-term horizon. In particular, better managing slack time in the distant future may help reduce routing cost. This paper describes double-horizon based heuristics for the dynamic {PDPTW}. Computational results show the advantage of using a double-horizon in conjunction with insertion and improvement heuristics.},

Previous studies focused on solution algorithms for routing and scheduling challenges of a pickup and delivery problem with time windows, but the operational issues of the overall system performance under a partially dynamic environment have not been investigated. In this article, we explore the operating efficiency of a dispatching system with a degree of dynamism (i.e. a ratio of dynamic requests). It is found that a dispatching system incurs higher transportation costs and accepts fewer requests when the request arrivals are partially dynamic, as compared to static or fully dynamic scenarios. Operational policies are derived for the dispatcher to avoid the inefficient range of degree of dynamism if future demand can be anticipated.},

To handle random travel times, the state variable of our dynamic program includes all individual decisions over a relevant portion of the history. We propose a sampling-based strategy to approximate the value function under this high-dimensional state variable in a tractable manner. Under our value function approximation strategy, the fleet management problem decomposes into a sequence of time-indexed min-cost network flow subproblems that naturally yield integer solutions. Moreover, the subproblem for each time period further decomposes by the locations, making our model suitable for parallel computing.

	abstract = {Transportation problems, in terms of both passenger and freight applications, are increasingly being addressed with inter-modal solutions. This chapter discusses the problem of computing optimum paths on a network with many modes of transport and time-varying link costs and travel times, accounting for the fixed schedule modes and mode-switching delays. An efficient algorithm is introduced that computes optimum path trees from all nodes and possible discrete departure times, while accounting for travel and transfer delays, as well as differences in perceived costs associated with specific modes and transfers. The algorithm, called the time-dependent inter-modal minimum cost path ({TDIMCP}) algorithm, is extended to set the necessary framework for solving the problem of inter-modal routing of hazardous materials, taking into consideration both risk and cost at the transfer points and travel links. Travel and transfer risk associated with hazmat routing are incorporated into the cost calculation of the {TDIMCP} problem, considering both the likelihood of an incident and the consequences of that incident. The inter-modal hazmat routing algorithm is then applied to a series of scenarios on a test network to illustrate the behavior of the algorithm},

	abstract = {The distribution of goods based on road services in urban areas, usually known as City Logistics, contributes to traffic congestion and is affected by traffic congestion, generates environmental impacts and incurs in high logistics costs. Therefore a holistic approach to the design and evaluation of City Logistics applications requires an integrated framework in which all components could work together that is must be modelled not only in terms of the core models for vehicle routing and fleet management, but also in terms of models able of including the dynamic aspects of traffic on the underlying road network, namely if Information and Communication Technologies ({ICT}) applications are taken into account. This paper reports on the modelling framework developed in the national projects {SADERYL}-I and {II}, sponsored by the Spanish “Dirección General de Ciencia y Tecnología” ({DGCYT}) and tested in the European Project {MEROPE} of the {INTERREG} {IIIB} Programme. The modelling framework consists of a Decision Support System whose core architecture is composed by a Data Base, to store all the data required by the implied models: location of logistic centres and customers, capacities of warehouses and depots, transportation costs, operational costs, fleet data, etc.; a Database Management System, for the updating of the information stored in the data base; a Model Base, containing the family of models and algorithms to solve the related problems, discrete location, network location, street vehicle routing and scheduling; a Model Base Management System, to update, modify, add or delete models from the Model Base; a {GIS} based Graphic User Interface supporting the dialogues to define and update data, select the model suitable to the intended problem, generate automatically from the digital map of the road network the input graph for the Network Location and Vehicle Routing models, apply the corresponding algorithm, visualize the problem and the results, etc. To account for the dynamics of urban traffic flows the system includes an underlying dynamic traffic simulation model ({AIMSUN} in this case) which is able to track individually the fleet vehicles, emulating in this way the monitoring of fleet vehicles in a real time fleet management system, gathering dynamic data (i.e. current position, previous position, current speed, previous speed, etc.) while following the vehicle, in a similar way as the data that in real life an equipped vehicle could provide. This is the information required by a “Dynamic Router and Scheduler” to determine which vehicle will be assigned to the new service and which will be the new route for the selected vehicle},

In emergency response operations, good vehicle dispatching strategies can result in more efficient service by reducing vehicles’ travel times and system preparation time and the coordination between these components directly influences the effectiveness of activities involved in emergency response. In this chapter, an integrated emergency response fleet deployment system is proposed which embeds an optimization approach to assist the dispatch center operators in assigning emergency vehicles to emergency calls, while having the capability to look ahead for future demands. The mathematical model deals with the real time vehicle dispatching problem while accounting for the service requirements and coverage concerns for future demand by relocating and diverting the on-route vehicles and remaining vehicles among stations. A rolling-horizon approach is adopted in the model to reduce the relocation sites in order to save computation time. A simulation program is developed to validate the model and to compare various dispatching strategies},

We consider an elementary version of the problem where trip requests arrive in time and require an immediate vehicle assignment (which triggers an appropriate route update of the selected vehicle). In this context, a relatively general objective can be stated as a weighted sum of the system's effort and the customers' inconvenience. However, optimizing almost any objective in this immensely complex stochastic system is prohibitively difficult. Thus the earlier work has largely resorted to heuristic cost functions that arise, e.g., from the corresponding static systems. By using the framework of Markov decision processes and the classical M/M/1 queue as a highly abstract model for a single vehicle, we explain why certain intuitive cost functions indeed give satisfactory results in the dynamic system, and also give an explicit interpretation of different components appearing in a general cost function. The resulting family of heuristic control policies is demonstrated to offer a desired type of performance thus justifying the assumed analogy between a multi-queue and dial-a-ride systems.},

	abstract = {Pickup and delivery problems have numerous applications in practice such as parcel delivery and passenger transportation. In the dynamic variant of the problem, not all information is available in advance but is revealed during the planning process. Thus, it is crucial to anticipate future events in order to generate high-quality solutions. Previous work has shown that the use of waiting strategies has the potential to save costs and maximize service quality. We adapt various waiting heuristics to the pickup and delivery problem with time windows. Previous research has shown, that specialized waiting heuristics utilizing anticipatory knowledge potentially outperform general heuristics. Direct policy search based on evolutionary computation and a simulation model is proposed as a methodology to automatically specialize waiting strategies to different problem characteristics. Based on the strengths of the previously introduced waiting strategies, we propose a novel waiting heuristic that can utilize historical request information based on an intensity measure which does not require an additional data preprocessing step. The performance of the waiting heuristics is evaluated on a single set of benchmark instances containing various instance classes that differ in terms of spatial and temporal properties. The diverse set of benchmark instances is used to analyze the influence of spatial and temporal instance properties as well as the degree of dynamism to the potential savings that can be achieved by anticipatory waiting and the incorporation of knowledge about future requests.},

Three exact branch-price-and-cut algorithms are proposed for this problem. The first incorporates the {LIFO} constraints in the master problem. The second one handles the {LIFO} constraints directly in the shortest path pricing problem. It applies a dynamic programming algorithm relying on an ad hoc dominance criterion. The third algorithm is a hybrid between the first two methods.

	abstract = {Engineering collective adaptive systems ({CAS}) is a challenging task. Concurrent systems, esp. when being large-scale, are known to be hard to design as the overall system behavior non-linearly results from local behavior and interactions. They are also hard to engineer and debug, as time dependent errors are often hard to reproduce. Simulation tools and environments are often used to assist in this task. From our experience in developing and using simulators for decentralized systems (in traffic, logistics and smart power grid management), we learned that a simulation environment should comply to the following quality criteria. First, from a software engineering point of view, a simulation environment itself must be designed up to the highest software quality standards - modularity, separation of concerns, test-driven development, guaranteed state consistency, etc. are particularly important quality criteria to ensure correctness, extensibility and manageability of the software. Second, the simulation environment must provide convenient support for using and extending the simulation environment, ease the visualization of solutions, and - since its use in scientific process - offer direct support for evaluating {CAS} through the set-up of experiments. In this paper, we present {RinSim}, an open source simulator that explicitly addresses these quality criteria, and targets the large family of transportation and logistics applications. {RinSim} separates the definition of the problem domain from the solution, has a modular design, is being developed in a test-driven way, etc. {RinSim} has been used and extended in a variety of cases within our research group, and served as the core platform in our educational program on multi-agent software development.},

Each customer request requires the use of a single vehicle both to load a specified amount of goods at one location and to deliver them to another location. All requests must be performed without violating either the vehicle capacity or the customer time window stipulated at each location. In this paper, we present a reactive tabu search approach to solve the pickup and delivery problem with time windows using three distinct move neighborhoods that capitalize on the dominance of the precedence and coupling constraints. A hierarchical search methodology is used to dynamically alternate between neighborhoods in order to negotiate different regions of the solution space and adjust search trajectories. In order to validate our technique's effectiveness, we have constructed a new set of benchmark problems for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows based on Solomon's benchmark vehicle routing problem with time windows data sets. Computational results substantiate the solution quality and efficiency of our reactive tabu search approach.},

	abstract = {We consider a pickup and delivery vehicle routing problem commonly encountered in real-world logistics operations. The problem involves a set of practical complications that have received little attention in the vehicle routing literature. In this problem, there are multiple carriers and multiple vehicle types available to cover a set of pickup and delivery orders, each of which has multiple pickup time windows and multiple delivery time windows. Orders and carrier/vehicle types must satisfy a set of compatibility constraints that specify which orders cannot be covered by which carrier/vehicle types and which orders cannot be shipped together. Order loading and unloading sequence must satisfy the nested precedence constraint that requires that an order cannot be unloaded until all the orders loaded into the truck later than this order are unloaded. Each vehicle trip must satisfy the driver's work rules prescribed by the Department of Transportation which specify legal working hours of a driver. The cost of a trip is determined by several factors including a fixed charge, total mileage, total waiting time, and total layover time of the driver. We propose column generation based solution approaches to this complex problem. The problem is formulated as a set partitioning type formulation containing an exponential number of columns. We apply the standard column generation procedure to solve the linear relaxation of this set partitioning type formulation in which the resulting master problem is a linear program and solved very efficiently by an {LP} solver, while the resulting subproblems are computationally intractable and solved by fast heuristics. An integer solution is obtained by using an {IP} solver to solve a restricted version of the original set partitioning type formulation that only contains the columns generated in solving the linear relaxation. The approaches are evaluated based on lower bounds obtained by solving the linear relaxation to optimality by using an exact dynamic programming algorithm to solve the subproblems exactly. It is shown that the approaches are capable of generating near-optimal solutions quickly for randomly generated instances with up to 200 orders. For larger randomly generated instances with up to 500 orders, it is shown that computational times required by these approaches are acceptable.},

Experimental results show the effectiveness of the algorithm which has produced many new best solutions on problems with 100, 200, and 600 customers. In particular, it has improved 47\% and 76\% of the best solutions on the 200 and 600-customer benchmarks, sometimes by as much as 3 vehicles.

Message pickup and delivery locations are uniformly distributed in a convex region. The vehicles are required to pickup and deliver the messages so that the average delay is minimized. It is required that the vehicle that picks up a message must be the one to deliver it. This problem is called the dynamic pickup and delivery problem ({DPDP}) and has applications in the context of autonomous vehicles and wireless ad hoc networks. The control policies considered are separable into two parts: an assignment policy used by a centralized controller to assign arriving messages to the vehicles for service and a service policy used by each vehicle to determine the service routes through its assigned messages. Lower bounds are provided on the delay achievable by separable control policies that depend on the information constraints in place. It is proved that the optimal average delay scaling can be reduced when message destination information is available to the centralized controller in addition to the message source information. The paper also provides policies that achieve these scaling bounds, proving that these bounds are tight.},

Such a definition however, loses meaning when considering purely dynamic problems where all customer requests arrive dynamically. Existing measures of dynamism are limited to either (1) measuring the proportion of online versus offline orders or (2) measuring urgency, a concept that is orthogonal to dynamism, instead. The present paper defines separate and independent formal definitions of dynamism and urgency applicable to purely dynamic problems. Using these formal definitions, instances of a dynamic logistic problem with varying levels of dynamism and urgency were constructed and several route scheduling algorithms were executed on these problem instances. Contrary to previous findings, the results indicate that dynamism is positively correlated with route quality; urgency, however, is negatively correlated with route quality. The paper contributes the theory that dynamism and urgency are two distinct concepts that deserve to be treated separately.},

Existing work investigates this hypothesis in a limited way, often with no support for further evaluation, slowing down the advance of more general conclusions. Investigating this hypothesis more systematically is time consuming as it requires four main components: (1) formal metrics for the variables of interest, (2) a problem instance generator using these metrics, (3) (de)centralized algorithms and (4) a simulation platform that facilitates the execution of these algorithms. Present paper describes the construction of an instance generator based on previously established formal metrics and simulation platform with support for (de)centralized algorithms. Using our instance generator, a benchmark logistics dataset with varying levels of dynamism and scale is created and we demonstrate how it can be used for systematically evaluating {MAS} and centralized algorithms in our simulator. This benchmark dataset is essential for enabling the adoption of a more thorough and systematic evaluation methodology, allowing increased insight in the strengths and weaknesses of both the {MAS} paradigm and operational research methods.},

	abstract = {Multi-agent systems ({MAS}) literature often assumes decentralized {MAS} to be especially suited for dynamic and large scale problems. In operational research, however, the prevailing paradigm is the use of centralized algorithms. Present paper empirically evaluates whether a multi-agent system can outperform a centralized algorithm in dynamic and large scale logistics problems. This evaluation is novel in three aspects: (1) to ensure fairness both implementations are subject to the same constraints with respect to hardware resources and software limitations, (2) the implementations are systematically evaluated with varying problem properties, and (3) all code is open source, facilitating reproduction and extension of the experiments. Existing work lacks a systematic evaluation of centralized versus decentralized paradigms due to the absence of a real-time logistics simulator with support for both paradigms and a dataset of problem instances with varying properties. We extended an existing logistics simulator to be able to perform real-time experiments and we use a recent dataset of dynamic pickup-and-delivery problem with time windows instances with varying levels of dynamism, urgency, and scale. The {OptaPlanner} constraint satisfaction solver is used in a centralized way to compute a global schedule and used as part of a decentralized {MAS} based on the dynamic contract-net protocol ({DynCNET}) algorithm. The experiments show that the {DynCNET} {MAS} finds solutions with a relatively lower operating cost when a problem has all following three properties: medium to high dynamism, high urgency, and medium to large scale. In these circumstances, the centralized algorithm finds solutions with an average cost of 112.3\% of the solutions found by the {MAS}. However, averaged over all scenario types, the average cost of the centralized algorithm is 94.2\%. The results indicate that the {MAS} performs best on very urgent problems that are medium to large scale.},

We research how to create a decentralized multi-agent system that can solve the dynamic dial-a-ride problem. Normally multi-agent systems are hand designed for each specific application. In this paper we research the applicability of genetic programming to automatically program a multi-agent system that solves dial-a-ride problems. We evaluated the evolved system by running a number of simulations and compared it's performance to a selection hyper-heuristic. The results shows that genetic programming can be a viable alternative to hand constructing multi-agent systems.},

	abstract = {Pickup and delivery problems have numerous applications in practice such as parcel delivery and passenger transportation. In the dynamic variant of the problem, not all information is available in advance but is revealed during the planning process. Thus, it is crucial to anticipate future events in order to generate high-quality solutions. Previous work has shown that the use of waiting strategies has the potential to save costs and maximize service quality. We adapt various waiting heuristics to the pickup and delivery problem with time windows. Previous research has shown, that specialized waiting heuristics utilizing anticipatory knowledge potentially outperform general heuristics. Direct policy search based on evolutionary computation and a simulation model is proposed as a methodology to automatically specialize waiting strategies to different problem characteristics. Based on the strengths of the previously introduced waiting strategies, we propose a novel waiting heuristic that can utilize historical request information based on an intensity measure which does not require an additional data preprocessing step. The performance of the waiting heuristics is evaluated on a single set of benchmark instances containing various instance classes that differ in terms of spatial and temporal properties. The diverse set of benchmark instances is used to analyze the influence of spatial and temporal instance properties as well as the degree of dynamism to the potential savings that can be achieved by anticipatory waiting and the incorporation of knowledge about future requests.},

The second algorithm produces precisely characterized, locally optimal solutions for large problems (up to 145 cities) in an extremely short time and is based on a general heuristic. approach believed to be of general applicability to various optimization problems. The average time required to obtain a locally optimal solution is under 30n3 microseconds where n is the number of cities involved. Repeated runs on a problem from random initial tours result in a high probability of finding the optimal solution among the locally optimal solutions obtained.

The combination of an on-demand and line-based service holds the promise of improved mobility and increased service coverage. However, to date, it remains unknown whether {DRT} services deliver these much anticipated improvements. This study presents an assessment framework to evaluate the performance of {DRT} and related changes in accessibility, and performs an empirical analysis for a recently introduced {DRT} service in the Netherlands. The framework includes a performance benchmark between {DRT} and {FT} based on the computation of generalized journey times of the {DRT} rides and the {FT} alternatives, and can help identify whether {DRT} is used as a complement or a substitute for {FT}. The framework covers the spatial and temporal dimensions, and the explicit consideration of rejected trips is an integral part of the evaluation. Results suggest large accessibility improvements for {DRT} users, especially for some underserved origin–destination pairs.},

It describes how previous manifestations of {FTS} provided dedicated solutions for special groups, often in parallel to the conventional public transport network, but highlights that in numerous countries across Europe there is now a discernable trend towards open access {FTS} providing services for the whole community and often feeding the conventional public transport network to provide wider access and opportunities. This is as a result of policies intended to mainstream services for people with disabilities and moves to tackle social exclusion amongst other groups while at the same time reducing the very high costs per trip associated with {STS}. To meet these policies, and the higher expectations and different travel behaviours of citizens to-day, it is suggested that {FTS} will need to radically reposition itself in terms of scale, so that there is mass coverage and ability to function as a full transport mode. This will require breakthroughs in concepts; business models; organisational and operational models; and in supporting technologies. A proposed solution to this is the Flexible Agency for Collective Mobility Services ({FAMS}) which provides an organisational structure and business model for {FTS} that incorporates the required supporting technologies.},

Such platforms have to simulate in detail, not only the dynamically changing demand and supply of the relevant service, but also traffic flow and other relevant transport services. This paper presents the {DVRP} extension to the open-source {MATSim} simulator. The extension is designed to be highly general and customizable to simulate a wide range of dynamic rich vehicle routing problems. The extension allows plugging in of various algorithms that are responsible for continuous re-optimisation of routes in response to changes in the system.

In this research, a two-stage framework for solving dynamic vehicle routing problem is proposed. In the first stage, the sweep method is adopted in vehicle assignment. In the second stage, a tabu search algorithm is implemented to improve routes under real-time information. The framework is implemented in an object-oriented approach and possible benefit from real-time information is illustrated through numerical simulation. The simulation-assignment model, {DynaTAIWAN} is applied in numerical simulation to evaluate real-time routing strategies in a traffic network. Numerical experiments are conducted in a 50 Nodes Network and a Taichung City. The results show that positive benefits could be achieved through utilization of real-time information with careful design.},

However, many systems fail due to poor implementation, planning, and marketing. Being able to realistically simulate a system to evaluate its viability before implementation is important. This review investigates the application of agent-based simulation for studying {DRT}. We identify that existing simulations are strongly focused on the optimisation of trips, usually in favour of the operator, and rarely consider individual preferences and needs. Agent-based simulations, however, permit incorporation of the latter, as well as capture the interactions between operators and customers. Several areas of future research are identified in order to unify future research efforts.},

	shorttitle = {Optimizing agents with genetic programming},
	abstract = {Dynamic pickup and delivery problems ({PDPs}) require online algorithms for managing a fleet of vehicles. Generally, vehicles can be managed either centrally or decentrally. A common way to coordinate agents decentrally is to use the contract-net protocol ({CNET}) that uses auctions to allocate tasks among agents. To participate in an auction, agents require a method that estimates the value of a task. Typically, this method involves an optimization algorithm, e.g. to calculate the cost to insert a customer. Recently, hyper-heuristics have been proposed for automated design of heuristics. Two properties of automatically designed heuristics are particularly promising: (1) a generated heuristic computes quickly, it is expected therefore that hyper-heuristics perform especially well for urgent problems, and (2) by using simulation-based evaluation, hyper-heuristics can create a ‘rule of thumb’ that anticipates situations in the future. In the present paper we empirically evaluate whether hyper-heuristics, more specifically genetic programming ({GP}), can be used to improve agents decentrally coordinated via {CNET}. We compare several {GP} settings and compare the resulting heuristic with existing centralized and decentralized algorithms based on the {OptaPlanner} optimization library. The tests are conducted in real-time on a dynamic {PDP} dataset with varying levels of dynamism, urgency, and scale. The results indicate that the evolved heuristic always outperforms the optimization algorithm in the decentralized multi-agent system ({MAS}) and often outperforms the centralized optimization algorithm. Our paper demonstrates that designing {MASs} using genetic programming is an effective way to obtain competitive performance compared to traditional operational research approaches. These results strengthen the relevance of decentralized agent based approaches in dynamic logistics.},

Dynamic networks provide an important foundation for addressing many problems in logistics planning. Algorithms that have been specialized for dynamic networks are presented. The results for solving infinite networks, including both exact results for stationary infinite networks, and model truncation techniques are briefly discussed. The chapter presents basic results and concepts from the field of stochastic programming, oriented toward their application to network problems.
